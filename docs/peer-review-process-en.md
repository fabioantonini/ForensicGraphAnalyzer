AVAILABLE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:
[Previous call data]

DETAILED ENFSI FRAMEWORK - evaluate each sub-criterion:
[Detailed structure with all 39 sub-criteria]

For each SUB-CRITERION provide:
- Score: 0-100
- Evidence: specific quote from document (if present)  
- Gap: what specifically is missing
- Severity: how serious the gap is

IMPORTANT: For CRITICAL ISSUES (score < 70 with "critical" or "high" severity):
- Identify max 3 most serious problems compromising ENFSI compliance
- For each problem, provide a SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATION including:
  * Concrete steps to follow
  * References to ENFSI standards
  * Implementation example or template
  * Expected result

JSON RESPONSE:
{
  "categories": {
    "structureInfo": {
      "overallScore": 85,
      "subcriteria": {
        "caseIdentifier": { "score": 90, "evidence": "quote", "gap": "missing detail", "severity": "medium" }
      }
    }
  },
  "criticalIssues": [...]
}
```

### Configuration Parameters
- **Model**: `gpt-4o`

## üí° CALL 3: Actionable Suggestions Generation

### Purpose
Create specific prioritized recommendations to improve ENFSI compliance

### Prompt Used
```
Based on the detailed ENFSI analysis, generate SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE suggestions to improve compliance.

ANALYSIS DATA:
[Detailed analysis results]

STRUCTURAL QUOTES:
[Extracted structural data]

Generate suggestions that are:
1. SPECIFIC: Not generic but based on identified gaps in the analysis
2. ACTIONABLE: With numbered and concrete steps to follow
3. PRIORITIZED: Ordered by impact on ENFSI compliance
4. WITH EXAMPLES: Provide practical templates/examples
5. MEASURABLE: Include expected improvement metrics

RECOMMENDATION GUIDELINES:
- Each recommendation must start with an action verb
- Include specific references to ENFSI standards
- Provide numbered steps: "1) [action], 2) [action], 3) [expected result]"
- Specify realistic implementation timelines
- Identify necessary resources/competencies

Provide response in structured JSON format:
{
  "prioritySuggestions": [
    {
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "category": "validation",
      "issue": "Lack of documented peer review process",
      "evidence": "No peer review is mentioned in the document",
      "recommendation": "Implement formal peer review process: 1) Identify qualified expert for independent review...",
      "example": "Template section: 'PEER REVIEW - This work has been reviewed by Dr. [Name]...'",
