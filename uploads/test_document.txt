This is a test document for forensic graphology analysis.

Forensic graphology is the scientific study of handwriting to analyze personality traits, behavioral patterns, and psychological characteristics. 

Key aspects of forensic graphology include:

1. Baseline analysis - The baseline refers to the invisible line on which handwriting rests. Straight baselines suggest stability and self-discipline. Ascending baselines may indicate optimism, while descending baselines could suggest fatigue or pessimism.

2. Pressure - The amount of pressure applied when writing can indicate energy levels and emotional intensity. Heavy pressure suggests strong emotions and vitality, while light pressure might indicate sensitivity or reserve.

3. Size - Large handwriting often reveals extroversion, while small handwriting may indicate introversion or focus on detail.

4. Slant - The slant of handwriting can reveal emotional responses. Right-slanted writing suggests outgoing, future-oriented personalities. Left-slanted writing may indicate reservation or past orientation. Vertical writing often reveals a balanced, controlled approach.

5. Spacing - Spacing between words and letters can indicate social behavior. Wide spacing might suggest a need for space and independence, while crowded spacing could indicate a desire for closeness.

Forensic graphology is used in various contexts, including criminal investigations, personnel selection, and psychological assessments. However, it should be combined with other analytical methods for the most accurate results.
